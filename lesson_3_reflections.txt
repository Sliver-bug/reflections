Q.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
	work local?
A.  When the team is disintegrated, and work is distributed.
    Can also be useful when need a hosting site for free. (:<>)

Q.	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
	automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A.	If we are working on a particular need for an older demand, we may require the
	system to 
	not be updated as needed. We will not be able to work on it as we wish, which will be very
	discomforting at the least.
	The ability to update as we want, is very available thus useful.

Q.	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
	use one instead of another?
A.	fork when we cant contribute to anyone, we want to make changes however
	clone when we can contribute and make changes
	branhes for parallel computing on my repo
