Q.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A.  When the team is disintegrated, and work is distributed.
    Can also be useful when need a hosting site for free. (:<>)

Q.	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A.	If we are working on a particular need for an older demand, we may require the system to 
	not be updated as needed. We will not be able to work on it as we wish, which will be very
	discomforting at the least.
	The ability to update as we want, is very available thus useful.
